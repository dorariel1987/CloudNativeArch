### Tasks: 


üîë 1. Identity & Authentication Layer
Objective:
Secure authentication and authorization for users and services in the platform.

Tasks:
Implement Identity Providers:

Configure Auth0/Keycloak for user and service authentication via OAuth2 and OpenID Connect (OIDC).
Set up JWT validation to ensure tokens are valid before allowing access to APIs.
Authentication Flows:

Set up OAuth2 authorization flows for service-to-service and user-to-service authentication.
Integrate JWT Validator for checking access tokens for validity before granting API access.
üõ°Ô∏è 2. API Security Layer
Objective:
Protect APIs and enforce security rules for all incoming requests.

Tasks:
API Gateway Configuration:

Deploy API Gateway (e.g., Kong, NGINX) to handle API routing, security policies, and rate limiting.
Security Policies:

Integrate Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against web attacks like SQL injections and XSS.
Set up Rate Limiter to prevent DDoS attacks or excessive API usage.
Traffic Flow:

Ensure all incoming requests are routed through the API Gateway.
Implement JWT and OAuth Validation as a first security step before reaching the services.
üï∏Ô∏è 3. Service Mesh Layer
Objective:
Ensure secure, observable, and controlled service-to-service communication.

Tasks:
Service Mesh Setup:
Deploy Istio for traffic routing, observability, and security enforcement (mTLS).
Integrate Cilium (eBPF-based security) for enforcing security policies and traffic management.
Service-to-Service Communication:
Enforce mTLS for encrypted communication between services within the mesh.
Define traffic policies to ensure only authorized services communicate with each other.
‚öôÔ∏è 4. Application Services
Objective:
Host microservices that contain the business logic and applications.

Tasks:
Microservices Deployment:
Deploy multiple microservices (Service 1, Service 2, Service 3) using Helm or Kustomize for Kubernetes.
Integration with Service Mesh:
Ensure each microservice communicates via the Service Mesh (Istio) for traffic management and security.
Configure Istio Ingress Gateway for external API access to services.
üì° 5. Observability Stack
Objective:
Monitor and log system activities to track health, performance, and security threats.

Tasks:
Distributed Tracing:

Implement OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for service tracing.
Use Tempo or Jaeger to visualize the trace data for debugging.
Metrics and Monitoring:

Set up Prometheus for collecting system and application metrics.
Use Grafana to visualize the collected metrics in dashboards.
Logging:

Integrate Vector to collect logs and Loki to store and analyze them.
üîç 6. Security Monitoring
Objective:
Detect and respond to runtime security threats and compliance violations.

Tasks:
Runtime Security Monitoring:

Deploy Falco to monitor containers for suspicious activity or violations (e.g., root user access).
Event Management:

Set up SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) to aggregate and analyze security events from different sources.
Alerting:

Integrate SIEM with Falco to send alerts for detected anomalies.
üíæ 7. Data Protection & Backup
Objective:
Ensure disaster recovery with secure, encrypted backups.

Tasks:
Backup Configuration:

Deploy Velero to take Kubernetes-native backups.
Store backups in immutable S3 storage (WORM) and ensure they are encrypted using Vault for added security.
Backup Recovery:

Test disaster recovery by restoring services from backups.
üìù 8. Policy Management
Objective:
Enforce security, compliance, and resource policies across the platform.

Tasks:
Policy Engine Setup:

Install and configure Kyverno for Kubernetes policy enforcement.
Policy Types:

Set up Pod Security Policies (PSP) to restrict container privileges.
Implement Network Policies to control which services can communicate with each other.
Policy Enforcement:

Monitor Kyverno to ensure new deployments comply with defined policies, and alert via SIEM if a policy is violated.
